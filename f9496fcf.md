# Combinatorial Analysis

## Motivation (counting problems)
A communication system is to consist of $n$ seemingly identical antennas that are to be lined up in a linear order. The resulting system will then be able to receive all incoming signals, and will be called *functional*, as long as no two consecutive antennas are defective. If it turns out that exactly $m$ of the $n$ antennas are defective, what is the probability that the resulting system will be functional? For instance, in the special case where $n = 4$ and $m = 2$, there are 6 possible system configurations, namely:

0 1 1 0 - Here 1 means the antenna is working and 0 means it's defective\
0 1 0 1\
1 0 1 0\
0 0 1 1\
1 0 0 1\
1 1 0 0

By analyzing the configurations we notice that we have a functional system in the first three cases the system is functional but in the last three it is not, which leads us to a reasonable conclusion that the probability that this system is functional is $\dfrac{3}{6} = \dfrac{1}{2}$. We could compute the probability for the general $m$ and $n$ case by counting the number of possible configurations of this system.

The preceding discussion shows how useful it is to *have an effective method for counting the number of ways that things can occur*
