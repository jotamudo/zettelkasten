# The Basic Principle of Counting

Suppose that two experiments are to be performed. Then if experiment 1 can result in any one of $m$ possible outcomes and if, for each outcome of experiment 1, there are $n$ possible outcomes of experiment 2, then together there are $mn$ possible outcomes of the two experiments.

* Proof:
By enumerating all possible outcomes we have a set $(i, j)$ of the possible outcomes of experiment 1 i-th and 2 j-th possible outcomes respectively taken into account together:

(1,1), (1,2), ... (1,n)\
(2,1), (2,2), ... (2,n)\
.\
.\
.\
(m,1), (m,2), ... (m,n)

Therefore, this set consists of $m$ rows with $n$ elements each, concluding the proof. â¬›
